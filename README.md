# covid-19-italy
A never published iOS app retrieving official data about the Covid-19 situation in Italy during the first wave of 2020. 

The idea behind this project was to download official JSON data from the git of the italian Protezione Civile that was updated daily during the first wave. All datas were then shown on a map with stats and official news about the pandemic. 

The project was abondoned when a lot of online services started to supply the same service.
